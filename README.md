ScaleBase was a program I created during my education at The Sixth Form College Farnborough. It uses JavaFX to create a GUI to display data taken from a SQLite database. Changes to the database can be made safely with respect to data redundancy by using the featues of the program. (!This program has a lot of rough edges and does not reflect my current coding ability!)
